# Fair Deal API
A RESTful API, CRUD backend, and demo portfolio app for  a fictional mechanic shop built using Node.js, Express.js framework, Sequelize ORM on a MySQL database for persistence.   Inspired by prior work for my mechanic. Enjoy! Angular and React.js based front-end to come later.

Live cloud based demo to come later.
